!# <purpose>
!# This module contains callback functions for the Poisson problem that are
!# used during the matrix/vector assembly for specifying analytical data.
!# There are three callback functions involved, which may be called depending
!# on the situation. All of them correspond to a specific interface for
!# callback functions, defined in 'intf_xxxx.inc' files.
!#
!# --- 1D version ---
!#
!# 1.) coeff_Laplace_1D
!#     -> Returns the coefficients for the Laplace matrix. This routine is
!#        only used if the problem to calculate has nonconstant coefficients!
!#        Otherwise the routine is dead.
!#     -> Corresponds to the interface defined in the file
!#        'intf_coefficientMatrixSc.inc'
!#
!# 2.) coeff_RHS_1D
!#     -> Returns analytical values for the right hand side of the Laplace
!#        equation. 2D case.
!#     -> Corresponds to the interface defined in the file
!#        'intf_coefficientVectorSc.inc'
!#
!# 3.) getBoundaryValues_1D
!#     -> Returns analytic values on the (Dirichlet) boundary of the
!#        problem to solve.
!#     -> Corresponds to the interface defined in the file
!#        'intf_bcassembly.inc'
!#
!# 4.) getBoundaryValuesMR_1D
!#     -> Returns discrete values on the (Dirichlet) boundary of the
!#        problem to solve.
!#     -> Corresponds to the interface defined in the file
!#        'intf_discretebc.inc'
!#
!# 5.) getReferenceFunction_1D
!#
!#     -> Returns the values of the analytic function and its derivatives,
!#        corresponding to coeff_RHS_1D for the 1D poisson-problem.
!#     -> Is only used for the postprocessing to calculate the $L_2$- and
!#        $H_1$-error of the FE function in comparison to the analytic
!#        function
